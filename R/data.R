#' Example metabolic thermal response curves
#'
#' A dataset containing example data of rates of photosynthesis and respiration of the phytoplankton Chlorella vulgaris. Instantaneous rates of metabolism were made across a range of assay temperatures to incorporate the entire thermal response of the populations. The dataset is the cleaned version so some datapoints have been omitted.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 649 rows and 7 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{curve_id}{a unique value for each separate curve}
#'   \item{temp}{the assay temperature at which the metabolic rate was measured (ºC)}
#'   \item{growth.temp}{the growth temperature that the culture was maintained at before measurements were taken (ºC)}
#'   \item{process}{whether the cultures had been kept for a long time at their growth temperature (adaptation/~100 generations) or a short time (a measure of acclimation/~10 generations)}
#'   \item{rep}{the replicate of the curve (1, 2 or 3)}
#'   \item{flux}{whether the curve depicts respiration or gross photosynthesis}
#'   \item{ln.rate}{the metabolic rate measured (µmol O2 µg C-1 hr-1)}
#' }
