## nlsLoop

Tools for expanding the non-linear regression method nls and nlsList from nlme.

### Issues and suggestions

Please report any issues/suggestions in the [issues link](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/nlsLoop/issues) for the repository.

Mac: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/padpadpadpad/nlsLoop.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/padpadpadpad/nlsLoop)

### Overview

The mainstay of this package is `nlsLoop::nlsLoop()`. If you have a dataset where you want to fit the same model over many levels of a factor, you may use `nlme::nlsList()`. However, `nlsList()` only allows for one set of starting values so it is possible that not all of the models will converge if the shape of the data, and thus likely parameter values, are very different.

`nlsLoop()` allows for a range of starting values and tries unlimited different starting values to the fit at each level of the factor, picking the best fit for each model using AIC scores. The best model 

### Tutorial

A more in-depth tutorial and explanation of parameters in `nlsLoop()` can be found as a [blog post](https://padpadpadpad.github.io/post/introducing-nlsloop/) or as a vignette of the package.

### Installation and examples

#### 1. Installation

```{r install, message=FALSE}
# install package
devtools::install_github("padpadpadpad/nlsLoop")

# load in nlsLoop
library(nlsLoop)

```

#### 2. Run nlsLoop()

```{r run nlsLoop, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
# load in example data set
data("Chlorella_TRC")

# run nlsLoop
fits <- nlsLoop(ln.rate ~ schoolfield.high(ln.c, Ea, Eh, Th, temp = K, Tc = 20),
                data = Chlorella_TRC,
                tries = 500,
                id_col = 'curve_id',
                param_bds = c(-10, 10, 0.1, 2, 0.5, 5, 285, 330),
                r2 = 'Y',
                supp.errors = 'Y',
                AICc = 'Y',
                na.action = na.omit,
                lower = c(ln.c=-10, Ea=0, Eh=0, Th=0))
```

#### 3. Check output

```{r look at data}
head(fits$params)
```

#### 4. Check fit of single curve

```{r first fit plot, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
# plot a single curve
plot_id_nlsLoop(raw_data = Chlorella_TRC, param_data = fits, id = '1')
```

#### 5. Check fit of all curves (creates a pdf)

```{r pdf fits, eval=FALSE}
# create pdf of each curve
plot_all_nlsLoop('path/of/where/you/want/to/save/me.pdf', raw_data = Chlorella_TRC, param_data = fits)
```
