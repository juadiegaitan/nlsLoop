\title{Loops through a non-linear model on many different curves to find the best
possible fit.}
\usage{
nlsLoop(model, data, tries, id_col, param_bds, r2 = "N", supp.errors = "N",
  AICc = "Y", control, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{The formula that is usually fed into nlsLM. Make sure there is
a y and an x (the column in your dataframe that is the explanatory variable)
eg. ln.resp.cor ~ schoolfield.high(ln.c, Ea, Eh, Th, temp=K, Tc = 25)}

\item{data}{Data that includes the rates}

\item{tries}{Number of combinations of different starting parameters that
are tried on each curve.}

\item{id_col}{The column name that identifies each curve that is to be
fitted. Needs to be in speech marks, ' '.}

\item{param_bds}{Upper and lower boundaries for the start parameters. If
missing these default to +/- 1e+09. Need to specified as a vector as :
c(lower bound param 1, upper bound param 1, lower bound param 2, upper bound
param 2 etc)}

\item{r2}{Whether or not you want the quasi rsquared value to be returned.
This defaults to no, (so not specifying the argument or r2 = 'N' results in
no r2 values being returned), to include the r2 values use r2 = 'Y'}

\item{supp.errors}{If supp.errors = 'Y' then no error messages will be shown
from the actual nlsLM function, reducing the number of error messages
received while the model works through starting parameters from which the
model cannot converge. Advised to only be used once it is expected that
error messages in the nlsLM function are not important.}

\item{AICc}{Whether or not the small sample AIC should be used. Defaults to
'Y'. Override this using AICc == 'N'. AICc should be used instead of AIC
when sample size is small in comparison to the number of estimated
parameters (Burnham & Anderson 2002 recommend its use when n / K < 40).}

\item{control}{If specific control arguments are desired they can be specified using nls.lm.control here}

\item{\dots}{Extra arguments to pass to nlsLM if necessary.}
}
\value{
Returns a list of class nlsLoop. Notable elements within the list are $params and $predictions that give the best fit parameters and predictions based on these parameters.
}
\description{
Fits the best possible model to each of a set of curves using non-linear
least squares regression using nlsLM. The best fit is determined using AIC
scores.
}
\details{
Returns a list of objects which includes a parameter dataframe of the best estimated parameter
fits for each level of `id_col` with associated AIC score.

%% ~~ If necessary, more details than the description above ~~
}
\note{
Useful additional arguments for nlsLM include: na.action = na.omit,

lower/upper = c() where these represent upper and lower boundaries for
parameter estimates
