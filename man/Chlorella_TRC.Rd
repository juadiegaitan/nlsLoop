\title{Example metabolic thermal response curves}
\format{A data frame with 649 rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
  \item{curve_id}{a unique value for each separate curve}
  \item{temp}{the assay temperature at which the metabolic rate was measured (ºC)}
  \item{growth.temp}{the growth temperature that the culture was maintained at before measurements were taken (ºC)}
  \item{process}{whether the cultures had been kept for a long time at their growth temperature (adaptation/~100 generations) or a short time (a measure of acclimation/~10 generations)}
  \item{flux}{whether the curve depicts respiration or gross photosynthesis}
  \item{ln.rate}{the metabolic rate measured (µmol O2 µg C-1 hr-1)}

}
\description{
A dataset containing example data of rates of photosynthesis and respiration of the phytoplankton Chlorella vulgaris. Instantaneous rates of metabolism were made across a range of assay temperatures to incorporate the entire thermal response of the populations. The dataset is the cleaned version so some datapoints have been omitted.
