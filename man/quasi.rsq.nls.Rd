\title{R squared statistic for non linear models}
\usage{
quasi.rsq.nls(mdl, y, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdl}{model object from which R^2 is desired. Used to calculate the
residual sum of squares.}

\item{y}{the dependent variable in the model.}

\item{param}{the number of parameters of the non-linear model}
}
\value{
value of r squared for specific non-linear model object
}
\description{
Calculates a quasi-rsquared value for non linear least squares regression
models. The formula for calculating this is given in the paper in the
references (Spiess 2010).
}
\details{
Cautionary notes of whether its useful are provided in the stack overflow
reference. A personal highlight of which is 'If someone asks for rope to
hang themselves, its fine to give it to them (while performing due diligence
by asking "are you sure you want to do this?")'

Calculated as :

1 - (n-1)/(n-param) * (1 - R^2)

where R^2 = 1 - RSS/TSS

RSS is the residual sum of squares given by deviance(mdl)

TSS is given by how much variance there is in the dependent variable:

(n - 1)*var(y)
